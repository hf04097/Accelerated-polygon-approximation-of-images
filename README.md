# Polygon-Approximation-of-Images-Using-PyCUDA
Polygon approximation is an interesting application and lends itself to uses in several domains. This approximation is primarily used for compression as complex images and figures can be represented in significantly less amount of data and require much less computation while preserving the essential information about the curve and the image.
